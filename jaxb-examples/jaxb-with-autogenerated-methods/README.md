jaxb-with-autogenerated-methods
=================

In this example I generate Java classes starting from xsd schema and generate common method `hashCode` and `equals`.
I used the 'maven-jaxb2-plugin', it's output directory is `target/jaxb-generated`.

	In order to generate java classes you must type `mvn clean package`
